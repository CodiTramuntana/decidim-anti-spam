# Dictionary Detection
The dictionary detection takes a list of words, one per line, and matches these words with the submitted content.

**When to use**  
This is useful when spammers often post spam without much text. A common spammer strategy is to write links in their profiles and then post content all over the platform to reference their created profile.

**Outputs of this detection**  
- `Word matches with dictionary`: When the detection finds a word in the list.
